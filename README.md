# Blackjack: Prototype
A UI-less and network-less Blackjack game playing in IDE or terminal.

Best recommended is Microsoft VS Code. PyCharm is great, too.

Terminal is also a decent place.

## Dependencies
Python's built-in packages are well enough for Prototype's birth and life~

Just have a Python 3 and you can enjoy Blackjack everywhere!

## Use
In IDE, locate at folder prototype, open main.py and press the run button.

Or if you are in terminal, do the commands according to your environment.

For IOS & Linux:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
For Windows:
```bash
python main.py
```
Make sure your current directory is at folder prototype, where main.py is stored.

And then it is keyboard to let you play Y(^_^)Y
