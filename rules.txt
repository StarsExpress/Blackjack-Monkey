Blackjack Rules:

1. 6 decks of cards without any dealer's hole card.
2. Minimum bet is 300, maximum bet is 10,000, and must be 100's multiple.
3. Dealers stand on soft 17 (Ex: A & 6).
4. Surrender returns 50% of placed bets, but is not allowed against dealer's Ace.
5. Blackjack (a combo of A & 10-valued card at a hand's first 2 cards) pays 3 to 2, a profit 150% of placed bets.
6. A combo of A & 10-valued card after split counts as ordinary 21, not Blackjack.
7. Identically-valued combos (Ex: J & 10) can split 3 times to 4 hands at most, except for Aces, with just once per hand.
8. No hits allowed after Aces are split.
9. Double down on any 2 cards is allowed, except for Blackjack and split Aces.
